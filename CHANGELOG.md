## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-27

### Added - üöÄ Reliability, Modern Python & Security Features

#### Safe Mode (Security & Resource Control) üîí
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Run tasks in isolated subprocesses
  - Process isolation prevents task failures from affecting parent
  - Resource limits (memory, CPU) on Unix/Linux/Mac
  - Timeout enforcement at OS level
  - Output sanitization (10KB limit)
  - Environment variable `AUTOCRON_SAFE_MODE=1` for detection
- **Resource Limits**:
  - `safe_mode=True` - Enable subprocess isolation
  - `max_memory_mb=256` - Memory limit in MB (Unix only)
  - `max_cpu_percent=50` - CPU usage limit (Unix only)
  - Automatic cleanup on violations
- **Use Cases**:
  - Running untrusted or user-provided scripts
  - Production environments with strict SLAs
  - Multi-tenant task scheduling
  - Tasks with unknown resource requirements
- **Platform Support**:
  - Full resource limits on Unix/Linux/Mac
  - Subprocess isolation on all platforms including Windows
  - Timeout enforcement cross-platform

#### Task Persistence (Durability)
- **Save/Load Tasks**: Persist task configuration and state across system restarts
  - `scheduler.save_tasks(path)` - Save all script-based tasks to YAML/JSON
  - `scheduler.load_tasks(path)` - Load tasks from file (merge or replace mode)
  - Default location: `~/.autocron/tasks.yaml`
  - Preserves task state: run counts, schedules, last/next run times
  - Safe mode settings are persisted
  - Support for both YAML and JSON formats
- **Task State Recovery**: Automatic recovery of execution history after restart
- **Function vs Script**: Only script-based tasks can be persisted (design choice)

#### Async/Await Support
- **Native Async Task Execution**: Schedule async functions alongside sync functions
  - Automatic detection of coroutine functions
  - No code changes needed - works with existing `@schedule` decorator
  - Mixed sync/async tasks in same scheduler
  - Efficient execution without blocking
- **Async Timeout Support**: Timeouts work for both sync and async tasks
- **Async Retries**: Full retry logic for async tasks
- **Async Callbacks**: Success/failure callbacks work with async functions

### Changed
- Task class now accepts `safe_mode`, `max_memory_mb`, `max_cpu_percent` parameters
- `add_task()` method supports safe mode configuration
- Scheduler now supports both synchronous and asynchronous functions
- `_execute_function()` automatically detects and handles async functions
- Added `_execute_async_function()` for async execution with timeout support
- Added `_execute_in_safe_mode()` for sandboxed subprocess execution
- Task class gains `to_dict()` and `from_dict()` methods for serialization
- AutoCron class gains persistence methods: `save_tasks()` and `load_tasks()`
- Safe mode execution provides detailed logging for security monitoring

### Testing
- Added 11 new tests for safe mode (`test_safe_mode.py`)
  - Basic execution, memory limits, timeouts, isolation
  - Persistence of safe mode settings
  - Output sanitization, retries, default behavior
- Added 15 new tests for persistence (`test_persistence.py`)
- Added 14 new tests for async support (`test_async.py`)
- Total: **124 tests** (up from 84)
- Coverage improved:
  - Overall: 41.42% with safe mode tests
  - Scheduler: 48.22% (includes all execution paths)
  - Critical security paths covered

### Documentation
- Updated SECURITY.md with Safe Mode section and best practices
- Added `safe_mode_example.py` with 6 comprehensive examples
- Added `persistence_example.py` with 5 practical examples
- Added `async_tasks_example.py` with 5 async usage patterns
- Updated API reference with new safe mode parameters

### Security
- Safe mode provides defense-in-depth for untrusted code execution
- Resource limits prevent denial-of-service from runaway tasks
- Output sanitization prevents log injection attacks
- Process isolation contains failures and errors
- See SECURITY.md for detailed best practices

### Technical Details
- **Safe Mode**: Cross-platform subprocess isolation with platform-specific limits
- **Async Implementation**: Uses `asyncio.run()` for isolated event loops
- **Persistence Format**: YAML/JSON with version and timestamp metadata
- **Thread Safety**: All operations respect existing locks
- **Backward Compatible**: All existing code continues to work

### Why These Features Matter
1. **Safe Mode** = Security & Stability
   - Protects system from malicious or buggy scripts
   - Prevents resource exhaustion
   - Isolates failures
   - Production-ready task execution
   
2. **Persistence** = Production-Ready Reliability
   - Tasks survive system restarts
   - Configuration can be version controlled
   - State recovery prevents duplicate executions
   
3. **Async Support** = Modern Python Best Practices
   - Work with async libraries (aiohttp, asyncpg, etc.)
   - Efficient I/O-bound task execution
   - No thread blocking for async operations

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-27

### Added - üéØ Hero Feature: Dashboard & Analytics
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Beautiful terminal dashboard with rich formatting
- **Task Analytics**: Automatic execution tracking for all tasks
  - Success/failure rates with visual indicators (‚úÖ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ùå)
  - Average execution duration tracking
  - Retry pattern analysis
  - Last 100 executions stored in JSON database (~/.autocron/analytics.json)
- **CLI Commands**:
  - `autocron dashboard` - View task summary with metrics
  - `autocron dashboard --live` - Real-time monitoring with auto-refresh
  - `autocron stats <task>` - Detailed task analysis
  - `autocron stats --export file.json` - Export analytics to JSON
- **Smart Recommendations**: AI-powered suggestions based on execution patterns
  - Low success rate warnings
  - High retry rate detection
  - Long duration alerts
  - Recent failure pattern analysis
- **Programmatic API**:
  - `show_dashboard()` - Display summary in code
  - `show_task(name)` - Show specific task details
  - `live_monitor()` - Start live monitoring
  - `Dashboard` and `TaskAnalytics` classes for custom integrations

### Changed
- Scheduler now automatically tracks all task executions
