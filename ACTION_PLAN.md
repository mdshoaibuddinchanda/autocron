- [ ] Add edge case tests
- [ ] Target: 85% overall coverage

### Day 3: Security Hardening
- [ ] Add sandbox escape tests
- [ ] Add process cleanup tests
- [ ] Test hung process handling
- [ ] Test timeout edge cases

### Day 4: Documentation Cleanup
- [ ] Cut repetition by 40%
- [ ] Keep only METRICS.md for scores
- [ ] Remove duplicate tables
- [ ] Modularize docs (/docs/security/, /docs/advanced/)

### Day 5: Final Verification
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Run Bandit
- [ ] Run Pylint
- [ ] Generate final report
- [ ] Update METRICS.md

**Week 3 Deliverables:**
- 85%+ coverage
- Security hardened
